acre

Acre was a map-based, massively multiplayer online trading game for iOS. It was written in Objective-C / CocoTouch, and supported by a set of services, written in ColdFusion in the dark days before I knew any server languages with AOP or ORM.

In Acre, the world was split into billions of acre-sized square plots. The plots were overlaid on the real map.  People could claim these plots, and use them to produce items. Whenever you logged into the game, you would see the map of your actual location, along with the lot overlay. You could, for example own the lot that covered your own house, or maybe the one that covered you favorite restaurant. 

Depending on where in the world your lot was, it would generate different resources. In Florida, for example, people got a lot of Oranges and Mangos. Other parts of the world had Iron, Corn, Oil, etc. You could either trade you resources with other folks playing the game, or you could build a factory that turned them into something else, usually money.

For a time, Acre had players all over the world. It was really fun to see players in unexpected places like Riyadh. In the end, there were never enough players to have the kind of density I had envisioned for trading, and eventually it died.
